        <Heading as="h1" size="xl">Biodiversity Gain Sites in England</Heading>

        <Text>Biodiversity gain sites in England are locations where new or improved habitats are created to achieve England&apos;s <ExternalLink href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Biodiversity+Net+Gain+(BNG)">Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG)</ExternalLink> requirement. Developers must now achieve at least a 10% increase in the biodiversity of a parcel of land following its development. If this is not possible within the development site itself - by creating or enhancing its existing habitats - the biodiversity gain must be delivered elsewhere, by developers paying for the same types of habitat at a different location. For this purpose, Biodiversity Gain Sites (BGS) have been made available by landowners, who will sell <ExternalLink href="https://www.google.com/search?q=biodiversity+units">biodiversity units</ExternalLink> to developers.</Text>
        <Text>You can search the list of sites here in various ways to find the most appropriate one for your needs.</Text>

        <Heading as="h2" size="lg">How we gathered the data</Heading>
        <Text>The data included in the list of biodiversity gain sites given here is compiled from various sources:</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">1. The BGS Register</Heading>
        <Text><ExternalLink href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/biodiversity-net-gain">Biodiversity Gain Site (BGS) Register</ExternalLink></Text>
        <Text><ExternalLink href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/biodiversity-net-gain/search">BGS Register Search</ExternalLink> This is the source of the base data. Until the data is provided publicly in computer-readable form, the data is extracted from the json files used to render the HTML website.</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">2. Responsible Bodies</Heading>
        <Text>Details of the responsible bodies are taken from the .GOV list <ExternalLink href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conservation-covenant-agreements-designated-responsible-bodies/conservation-covenants-list-of-designated-responsible-bodies">Conservation covenants: list of designated responsible bodies</ExternalLink>.</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">3. Locations</Heading>
        <Text>BGS Site locations are given but the precise location of allocations addresses has to be deduced using the Google Geocoder. Where the address is incomplete or missing, the location falls back to the centre point of the LPA.</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">4. Local Planning Authorities (LPAs)</Heading>
        <Text>The boundaries of all the English LPAs are used to identify the LPA in which a development site or BGS site is located</Text>
        <Text><ExternalLink href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-planning-authorities-april-2023-names-and-codes-in-the-uk/explore">All LPAs</ExternalLink>.</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">5. National Character Areas (NCAs)</Heading>
        <Text>The boundaries of NCAs are used to identify the NCA in which a development site or BGS site is located.</Text>
        <Text><ExternalLink href="https://nationalcharacterareas.co.uk/">NCAs and their Profiles</ExternalLink>.</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">6. Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS)</Heading>
        <Text>The boundaries of LNRS sites are used to identify the LNRS in which a development site or BGS site is located</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">7. Deprivation</Heading>
        <Text>Deprivation refers to people’s unmet needs, a lack of access to opportunities and resources which we might expect in our society.</Text>
        
        <Heading as="h3" size="md">7 a). Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)</Heading>
        <Text>LSOAs are small areas designed to be of a similar population size, with an average of approximately 1,600 residents or 650 households. There are 33,755 LSOAs in England. They are a standard statistical geography and were produced by the Office for National Statistics for the reporting of small area statistics. LSOAs are referred to as ‘neighbourhoods’ .</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">7 b). Decile</Heading>
        <Text>An decile is calculated by ranking the 33,755 neighbourhoods in England from most deprived to least deprived and dividing them into 10 equal groups (i.e. each containing 3,375 or 3,376 neighbourhoods). These deciles range from the most deprived 10 per cent of neighbourhoods nationally to the least deprived 10 per cent of neighbourhoods nationally.</Text>
        
        <Heading as="h2" size="lg">How we processed the data</Heading>
        <Text>We enhanced the base data extracted from the BGS register in a number of ways:</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">1. Site Habitats - HU calculations</Heading>
        <Text><ExternalLink href="https://bristoltreeforum.org/2024/10/28/biodiversity-gain-metric-calculating-habitat-units">Habitat Units explained</ExternalLink></Text>
        <Text>Baseline parcels are as per the standard formula – Habitat Unit (HU) = Habitat area/length (of parcel) x Distinctiveness (of Habitat) x Condition (of parcel) x Strategic Significance (where SS is set to Low, 1).</Text>

        <Heading as="h3" size="md">2. Improvements</Heading>
        <Text>Created parcels - HU = Habitat area/length (of parcel) x Distinctiveness (of Habitat) x Condition (of parcel) x Strategic Significance (of parcel – low, 1) x Temporal Risk (of Habitat and Condition) x Difficulty factor (of the Habitat) x Spatial Risk (Low, 1)</Text>
        <Text>Enhanced parcels - HU is not computed because no connection can be made back to the baseline habitat parcel&apos;s value.</Text>

        <Heading as="h2" size="lg">Refreshing the data</Heading>
        <Text>We refresh Defra&apos;s BGS data hourly.</Text>
